This repository is the prototype in A prototype written in Python to illustrate/demonstrate querying a tiny dataset extracted from the Learning Path Index Dataset (see [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neomatrix369/learning-path-index-dataset )

The dataset is stored in the folder named chroma, and can be found in the same directory. 

## Pre-requisites

- Python 3.9.x or above
- OpenAI API Key
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Basic Command-line experience
- Basic git and GitHub experience

## Known issue

- The AI can't do simple counting well. e.g. there are 3 courses in the dataset, but AI always returns 4 when its being asked how many courses in the database.

- The AI can't interpret course fee correctly when the fee is zero. Perhaps this can be fixed in prompt engineering.

- To get better accuracy in AI's interpretation on the dataset, further cleaning has to be done on the dataset.
